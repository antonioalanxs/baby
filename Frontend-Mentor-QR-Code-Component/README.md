<h3 align="center"><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a> challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.</h3>

## The challenge

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Have fun building! ðŸš€
